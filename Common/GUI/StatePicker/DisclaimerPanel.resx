    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>This software is intended to create interactive computer graphics of conditions that may be encountered in the human masticatory system, and no warranty is made that the models and simulations created hereby are true and accurate for any given patient.  Hence the models generated by this software cannot show the actual anatomy of any given patient, but may be used to illustrate a range of conditions that may or may not be similar to the clinical anatomy of the patient.  All input is operator dependent, and no two individuals are likely to create the exact same model, even when referencing the same diagnostic criteria.   Furthermore, these models and simulations should not be used for diagnostic purposes.  The accuracy of the computer projections is operator dependent and is intended only for demonstration of potential distortions of the masticatory system and face. It is the responsibility of the examining dentist or physician to rely upon the history and examination of the patient as well as tests that fulfill community standards of care to establish a diagnosis and recommendation of treatment to patients for their conditions, defects, distortions, or diseases.  Additional diagnostic tests fulfilling the community standard of care may be indicated to confirm the status of individual patient abnormalities that are simulated by this product.  No specific diagnosis or treatment modalities are to be inferred by this software product.  The sole intent of this product is to aid in communication between patient and doctor, and as such these models are meant to be no more representative of the actual patient condition than are diagrams or other user generated representations of known anatomical abnormalities that may be encountered in the population at large.  As such the operator assumes full responsibility for the reliance upon and quality of established diagnostic criteria in the creation of these software models.  Operators also assume full responsibility for accuracy of input, model creation, implied defect or dysfunction, and utilization of models and simulations in their communication with patients or clients.   No treatment recommendations may be made in part or in full from the models that are created.  Rather all treatment is the responsibility of the treating doctor and shall be based upon community standards which are independent of this software product.  Confirmation of the scientific accuracy of this product, whether stated or implied, is the responsibility of the user.  Any stated confirmations of accuracy of these models by users shall be based only upon conventional refereed professional abstracts, presentations, and publications.   No warranties are made that this software and the models and simulations created herein are reliable, accurate, or even a reasonable facsimile of the condition(s) of any patient.</value>
