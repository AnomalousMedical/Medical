# Anomalous Medical
Anomalous Medical is a 3d human anatomy simulation platform. It is unique from other similar programs in that it features an accurate simulation of the human mandible. It also allows posing of the skeletal system.

In addition to viewing anatomy you can build Smart Lectures, which combine a power point like interface with our 3d anatomy to build custom slideshows. For more information please see the [official website](https://www.anomalousmedical.com).

## Building
After building the native dependency and engine libraries open the solution for your chosen platform and build the project.

## Building Installer
To build the installer get the vc redist files for your version of visual studio and put them in the Dependencies repo under vcredist. Then build the AnomalousMedical/Installer/Windows/AnomalousMedical.iss file with [Innosetup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).

## Distribution of Derived Works
Threax Software, LLC reserves all rights to the AnomalousMedical.dat file and its contents. This file and its contents are only allowed to be downloaded from our official repositories. The icons and images and logos that appear in our software are similarly all rights reserved. You are free to modify and distribute only the source code and compiled binaries under the terms of the MIT license.

## Unsupported Configurations
The iOS and Mac OS versions are deprecated. With Apple's decision to [deprecate OpenGL](https://developer.apple.com/macos/whats-new/) this project deprecated the Apple platforms. The files are left for posterity or for the adventerous. Anomalous Medical is a volunteer effort and the decision was made to focus on platforms that offer both openness and stability. The last sucessful Apple platform builds were in 2016.
