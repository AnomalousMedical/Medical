                <Property key="Widget_Caption" value="This software is intended to create interactive computer graphics of conditions that may be encountered in the human masticatory system, and no warranty is made that the models and simulations created hereby are true and accurate for any given patient.  Hence the models generated by this software cannot show the actual anatomy of any given patient, but may be used to illustrate a range of conditions that may or may not be similar to the clinical anatomy of the patient.  All input is operator dependent, and no two individuals are likely to create the exact same model, even when referencing the same diagnostic criteria.   Furthermore, these models and simulations should not be used for diagnostic purposes.  The accuracy of the computer projections is operator dependent and is intended only for demonstration of potential distortions of the masticatory system and face. It is the responsibility of the examining dentist or physician to rely upon the history and examination of the patient as well as tests that fulfill community standards of care to establish a diagnosis and recommendation of treatment to patients for their conditions, defects, distortions, or diseases.  Additional diagnostic tests fulfilling the community standard of care may be indicated to confirm the status of individual patient abnormalities that are simulated by this product.  No specific diagnosis or treatment modalities are to be inferred by this software product.  The sole intent of this product is to aid in communication between patient and doctor, and as such these models are meant to be no more representative of the actual patient condition than are diagrams or other user generated representations of known anatomical abnormalities that may be encountered in the population at large.  As such the operator assumes full responsibility for the reliance upon and quality of established diagnostic criteria in the creation of these software models.  Operators also assume full responsibility for accuracy of input, model creation, implied defect or dysfunction, and utilization of models and simulations in their communication with patients or clients.   No treatment recommendations may be made in part or in full from the models that are created.  Rather all treatment is the responsibility of the treating doctor and shall be based upon community standards which are independent of this software product.  Confirmation of the scientific accuracy of this product, whether stated or implied, is the responsibility of the user.  Any stated confirmations of accuracy of these models by users shall be based only upon conventional refereed professional abstracts, presentations, and publications.   No warranties are made that this software and the models and simulations created herein are reliable, accurate, or even a reasonable facsimile of the condition(s) of any patient."/>
