          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\par
\par
    \par
(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination). \par
\par
(c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code. \par
\par
(d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version; 3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.\par
\par
 \par
3. Distribution Obligations. \par
    \par
\par
        Application of License.  The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in      Section 3.5.\par
\par
     \par
\par
        Availability of Source Code.  Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification      has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\par
\par
 \par
    \par
\par
        Description of Modifications.   You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\par
\par
 \par
    \par
\par
        Intellectual Property Matters\par
\par
 \par
\par
(a) Third Party Claims. \par
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's \par
          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights \par
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, \par
          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code \par
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the \par
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will \par
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after \par
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, \par
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies \par
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps \par
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) \par
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered \par
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained. \par
 \par
          (b) Contributor APIs. \par
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming \par
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which \par
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must \par
          also include this information in the LEGAL file. \par
 \par
               (c)    Representations. \par
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to \par
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's \par
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or \par
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by \par
          this License. \par
 \par
     3.5. Required Notices. \par
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source \par
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source \par
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a \par
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely \par
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) \par
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in \par
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation \par
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership \par
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to \par
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability \par
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You \par
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial \par
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than \par
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is \par
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial \par
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the \par
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, \par
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. \par
 \par
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. \par
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the \par
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, \par
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of \par
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, \par
     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the \par
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included \par
     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or \par
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the \par
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered \par
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may \par
     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in \par
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the \par
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's \par
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this \par
     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different \par
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ \par
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial \par
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the \par
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by \par
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such \par
     terms You offer. \par
 \par
     3.7. Larger Works. \par
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code \par
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger \par
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the \par
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. \par
 \par
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. \par
 \par
     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this \par
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to \par
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with \par
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) \par
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description \par
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must \par
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the \par
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be \par
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to \par
     understand it. \par
 \par
5. Application of this License. \par
 \par
     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has \par
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code. \par
 \par
6. Versions of the License. \par
 \par
     6.1. New Versions. \par
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised \par
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version \par
     will be given a distinguishing version number. \par
 \par
     6.2. Effect of New Versions. \par
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the \par
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that \par
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms \par
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one \par
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to \par
     Covered Code created under this License. \par
 \par
     6.3. Derivative Works. \par
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may \par
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code \par
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that \par
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", \par
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your \par
     license (except to note that your license differs from this License) \par
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license \par
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and \par
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial \par
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in \par
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of \par
     this License.) \par
 \par
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\par
\par
 \par
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. \par
 \par
8. TERMINATION.\par
\par
 \par
     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate \par
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure \par
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All \par
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall \par
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their \par
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License \par
     shall survive.\par
\par
 \par
     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement \par
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer \par
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom \par
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:\par
\par
 \par
     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly \par
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such \par
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License \par
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, \par
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) \par
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable \par
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such \par
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to \par
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days \par
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not \par
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim \par
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under \par
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of \par
     the 60 day notice period specified above.\par
\par
 \par
     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's \par
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then \par
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) \par
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, \par
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that \par
     Participant.\par
\par
 \par
     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant \par
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or \par
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as \par
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent \par
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses \par
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken \par
     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or \par
     license. \par
 \par
     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, \par
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) \par
     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder \par
     prior to termination shall survive termination. \par
 \par
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. \par
 \par
     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. \par
 \par
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. \par
 \par
     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in \par
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer \par
     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such \par
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 \par
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), \par
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those \par
     rights set forth herein. \par
 \par
11. MISCELLANEOUS. \par
 \par
     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject \par
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be \par
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent \par
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by \par
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if \par
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. \par
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, \par
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United \par
     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be \par
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern \par
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, \par
     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including \par
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and \par
     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on \par
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. \par
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract \par
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this \par
     License. \par
 \par
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. \par
 \par
     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is \par
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, \par
     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to \par
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such \par
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or \par
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. \par
 \par
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. \par
 \par
     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as \par
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial \par
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under \par
     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified \par
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A. \par

 \par
Introduction \par
============ \par
 \par
  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages; \par
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, \par
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the \par
  FreeType Project. \par
 \par
  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and \par
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license \par
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs, \par
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least. \par
 \par
  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG \par
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion \par
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products \par
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that: \par
 \par
    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be \par
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution) \par
 \par
    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or \par
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage) \par
 \par
    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use \par
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge \par
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the \par
      FreeType code. (`credits') \par
 \par
  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this \par
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products. \par
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and \par
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project. \par
 \par
 \par
  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a \par
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus \par
  encourage you to use the following text: \par
 \par
   """   \par

  actually use. \par

Legal Terms \par
=========== \par
 \par
0. Definitions \par
-------------- \par
 \par
  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project', \par
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally \par
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and \par
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, \par
  beta or final release. \par
 \par
  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where \par

 \par
2. Source Code License. \par
 \par
2.1. The Initial Developer Grant. \par
The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims: \par
 \par
(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and \par
 \par
(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell ("Utilize") the Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations. \par
 \par
2.2. Contributor Grant. \par
Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims: \par
 \par
(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and \par
 \par
(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that \par
may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations. \par
 \par
3. Distribution Obligations. \par
 \par
3.1. Application of License. \par
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or \par
restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. \par
 \par
3.2. Availability of Source Code. \par
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. \par
 \par
3.3. Description of Modifications. \par
You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. \par
 \par
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters \par
 \par
(a) Third Party Claims. \par
If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make \par
available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. \par
 \par
(b) Contributor APIs. \par
If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file. \par
 \par
3.5. Required Notices. \par
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its \par
structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or \par
liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of \par
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. \par
 \par
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. \par
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You \par
describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, \par
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. \par
 \par
3.7. Larger Works. \par
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. \par
 \par
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. \par
 \par
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. \par
 \par
5. Application of this License. \par
 \par
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code. \par
 \par
6. Versions of the License. \par
 \par
6.1. New Versions. \par
Floris van den Berg may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. \par
 \par
6.2. Effect of New Versions. \par
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Floris van den Berg \par
No one other than Floris van den Berg has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. \par
 \par
6.3. Derivative Works. \par
If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "FreeImage", `FreeImage Public License", "FIPL", or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the FreeImage Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) \par
 \par
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. \par
 \par
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. \par
 \par
8. TERMINATION. \par
 \par
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. \par
 \par
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. \par
 \par
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE \par
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. \par
 \par
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. \par
 \par
The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. \par
 \par
11. MISCELLANEOUS. \par
 \par
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by Dutch law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in, the The Netherlands: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Almelo, The Netherlands; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the court of Almelo, The Netherlands with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. \par
 \par
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. \par
 \par
Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based \par
on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute \par
responsibility on an equitable basis. \par

price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you \par
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for \par
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it \par
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it \par
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. \par
 \par
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid \par
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. \par
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if \par
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it. \par
 \par
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis \par
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave \par
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source \par
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide \par
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them \par
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling \par
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. \par
 \par
  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright \par
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal \par
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. \par
 \par
  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain \par
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free \par
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we \par
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original \par
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on \par
the original authors' reputations. \par
 \par
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software \par
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free \par
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect \par
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this, \par
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's \par
free use or not licensed at all. \par
 \par
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary \par
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This \par
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain \par
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary \par
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is \par
the same as in the ordinary license. \par
 \par
  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that \par
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a \par
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without \par
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is \par
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in \par
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a \par
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License \par
treats it as such. \par
 \par
  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General \par
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software \par
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We \par
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better. \par
 \par
  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the \par
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the \par
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to \par
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while \par
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free \par
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve \par
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards \par
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this \par
will lead to faster development of free libraries. \par
 \par
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and \par
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a \par
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The \par
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only \par
works together with the library. \par
 \par
  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary \par
General Public License rather than by this special one. \par
 \par
                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE \par
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION \par
 \par
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which \par
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized \par
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library \par
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is \par
addressed as "you". \par
 \par
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data \par
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs \par
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. \par
 \par
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work \par
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the \par
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under \par
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a \par
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated \par
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is \par
included without limitation in the term "modification".) \par
 \par
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for \par
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means \par
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated \par
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation \par
and installation of the library. \par
 \par
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not \par
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of \par
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from \par
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based \par
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for \par
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does \par
and what the program that uses the Library does. \par
   \par
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's \par
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that \par
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an \par
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact \par
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any \par
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the \par
Library. \par
 \par
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, \par
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a \par
fee. \par
 \par
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion \par
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and \par
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 \par
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: \par
 \par
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library. \par
 \par
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices \par
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. \par
 \par
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no \par
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. \par
 \par
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a \par
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses \par
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility \par
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, \par
    in the event an application does not supply such function or \par
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of \par
    its purpose remains meaningful. \par
 \par
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has \par
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the \par
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any \par
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must \par
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square \par
    root function must still compute square roots.) \par
 \par
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If \par
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, \par
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in \par
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those \par
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you \par
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based \par
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of \par
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the \par
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote \par
it. \par
 \par
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest \par
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to \par
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or \par
collective works based on the Library. \par
 \par
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library \par
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of \par
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under \par
the scope of this License. \par
 \par
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public \par
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do \par
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so \par
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, \par
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the \par
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify \par
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in \par
these notices. \par
 \par
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for \par
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all \par
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. \par
 \par
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of \par
the Library into a program that is not a library. \par
 \par
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or \par
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form \par
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany \par
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which \par
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a \par
medium customarily used for software interchange. \par
 \par
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy \par
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the \par
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to \par
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not \par
compelled to copy the source along with the object code. \par
 \par
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the \par
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or \par
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a \par
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and \par
therefore falls outside the scope of this License. \par
 \par
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library \par
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it \par
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the \par
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License. \par
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. \par
 \par
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file \par
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a \par
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. \par
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be \par
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The \par
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. \par
 \par
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data \par
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline \par
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object \par
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative \par
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the \par
Library will still fall under Section 6.) \par
 \par
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may \par
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. \par
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, \par
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. \par
 \par
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or \par
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a \par
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work \par
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit \par
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse \par
engineering for debugging such modifications. \par
 \par
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the \par
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by \par
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work \par
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the \par
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference \par
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one \par
of these things: \par
 \par
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding \par
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever \par
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under \par
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked \par
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that \par
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the \par
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified \par
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood \par
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the \par
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application \par
    to use the modified definitions.) \par
 \par
    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at \par
    least three years, to give the same user the materials \par
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more \par
    than the cost of performing this distribution. \par
 \par
    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy \par
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above \par
    specified materials from the same place. \par
 \par
    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these \par
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. \par
 \par
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the \par
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for \par
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception, \par
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally \par
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major \par
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on \par
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies \par
the executable. \par
 \par
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license \par
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally \par
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot \par
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you \par
distribute. \par
 \par
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the \par
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library \par
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined \par
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on \par
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise \par
permitted, and provided that you do these two things: \par
 \par
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work \par
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library \par
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the \par
    Sections above. \par
 \par
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact \par
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining \par
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. \par
 \par
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute \par
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any \par
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or \par
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your \par
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, \par
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses \par
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. \par
 \par
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not \par
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or \par
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are \par
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by \par
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the \par
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and \par
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying \par
the Library or works based on it. \par
 \par
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the \par
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the \par
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library \par
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further \par
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. \par
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to \par
this License. \par
 \par
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent \par
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), \par
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or \par
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not \par
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot \par
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this \par
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you \par
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent \par
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by \par
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then \par
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to \par
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. \par
 \par
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any \par
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, \par
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. \par
 \par
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any \par
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any \par
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the \par
integrity of the free software distribution system which is \par
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made \par
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed \par
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that \par
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing \par
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot \par
impose that choice. \par
 \par
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to \par
be a consequence of the rest of this License. \par
 \par
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in \par
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the \par
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add \par
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, \par
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus \par
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if \par
written in the body of this License. \par
 \par
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new \par
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. \par
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, \par
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. \par
 \par
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library \par
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \par
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and \par
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by \par
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a \par
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by \par
the Free Software Foundation. \par
 \par
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free \par
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, \par
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is \par
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free \par
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our \par
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status \par
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing \par
and reuse of software generally. \par
 \par
                            NO WARRANTY \par
 \par
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO \par
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. \par
 \par
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. \par
 \par
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS \par
 \par
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries \par
 \par
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest \par
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that \par
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting \par
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the \par
ordinary General Public License). \par
 \par
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is \par
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively \par
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \par
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. \par
 \par
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.> \par
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> \par
 \par
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or \par
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public \par
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either \par
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. \par
 \par
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, \par
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of \par
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.   \par
\par
See the GNU \par
    Library General Public License for more details. \par
 \par
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public \par
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software \par
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA \par
 \par
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. \par
 \par
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your \par
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if \par
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names: \par
 \par
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the \par
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker. \par
 \par
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990 \par

 \par
That's all there is to it! \par
